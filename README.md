# Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM
Overview:
The Diabetes Prediction project is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. It utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a powerful machine learning technique for classification tasks. The dataset used for this project includes relevant health parameters such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and blood pressure.

Key Steps in the Project:

Data Loading: Import and load the dataset containing health-related features and diabetes labels.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, if any, and preprocess the data for training the SVM model.
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features that contribute to the prediction task.
Imputation: Use SimpleImputer to fill in missing values in the dataset.
Model Training: Employ the SVM algorithm to train the model on the preprocessed data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the SVM model by tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Predictions: Make predictions on new data to identify individuals at risk of diabetes.
